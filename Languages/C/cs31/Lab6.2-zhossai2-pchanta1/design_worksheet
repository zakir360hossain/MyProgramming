Directions: Complete this worksheet for a function before you start coding it.
==========  (to print:  lpr design_worksheet)
* It will help you plan out the design of each of your functions. 
* You must bring this worksheet with you to a ninja session & office hours 
TODO: (1) Fill out worksheet for parse_cmd() then implement & test it
      (2) Fill out worksheet for parse_cmd_dynamic(), then implement & test it
--------------------------------------
(1) parse_cmd() design questions Q1-Q3
--------------------------------------
Reminders: A. Look at the LAB REQUIREMENTS and the parsecmd.h file for 
              details on exactly what this function should do. 
           B. This function should use the global variable cmdline_copy that 
              is already declared in the .c file 
Q1: What will this function do?  Write an outline of what it will need to do 
    at a high level, and then refine and fill in details. 
Q2: What logical chunks of functionality should be broken into helper
    functions? Note what functions you will define, what they accept as 
    parameters, and what their return values are.  
Q3: What are the local variables this function needs (and what are their 
    exact types) that this function needs to perform these steps?
