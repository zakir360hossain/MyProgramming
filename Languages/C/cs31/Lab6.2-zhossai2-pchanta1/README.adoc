= parse_cmd library lab

== Files

* `parsecmd.c`: file into which you will add your implementation of
   the two parsecmd library functions

* `parsecmd.h`:  the interface to the parsecmd library (its function 
   prototypes and constant definitions).  You should not change this
   file

* `tester.c`: a test program for testing your parsecmd library implemenation
   ** this file needs only minimal modifications to test the second 
      function (see the `TODO` comments).

* `design_worksheet`: contains some questions you should answer (in this file)
   before start coding each function.  This is to help you with the design 
   of each functions.

== building and running

* make: build the tester program that tests your parsecmd library
        implementation

  ** compiles parsecmd.o library from parsecmd.c 
  ** compiles tester from tester.c and linking in parsecmd.o

* make clean: clean up compiled files (parsecmd.o and tester)

To run:
[source,sh]
----
./tester
----
then just enter command lines to parse with your parsecmd library functions.
