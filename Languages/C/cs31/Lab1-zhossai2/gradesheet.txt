compute_average includes: 
  * result is about 1/2 way between [0,hi]
  * uses accumulator pattern to compute sum of values 
  * calls rand and read_int correctly
  * uses % to get value in range
  * perfoms float division 
  * returns correct type

>> your compute_average comments:
 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
get_in_range includes: 
  * loop until enter value in range
  * prints prompt
  * calls read_int
  * prints error msg if not
  * returns correct value

>>  your get_in_range comments:
 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
draw_picture includes: 
  * uses doubly-nested for loops
  * multiple inner loops to print space and star pattern each line
  * works correctly for differnet size input value
  * if doesn't draw correct picture, how close does it get:

>>  your draw_picture comments: 
 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Main control flow & program output includes: 
  * gets input correctly from user to pass to functions
  * prints correct output 
  * get_in_range used for 0, 1 draw again as well as for size value
  * draws at least one time 
  * allows user to choose to draw as many subsequent times as like

>>  your main control flow & program output comments:
 Need to check if the number of random values and largest value are
positive, otherwise prompting the user to enter new inputs until they
are valid. The get_in_range function could have been used for "draw
again."

-------------------------
Correctness (9pts): 8.5

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Program style includes: 
* top-level comment
* complete function comments
* no lines wrapped (>80 columns)
* meaningful variable and function names
* all local variables declared at top of function body before statements
* follows style guide
* good, readable program design

>>  your program style comments:
 Need to include your name and the date in the top-level comment -
refer to style guide, also keep lines <= 80 characters
