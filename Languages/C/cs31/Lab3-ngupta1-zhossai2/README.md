Part 1: build circuit from basic gates

        part1.circ

Part 2: build alu using existing logism circuits. Note that logisim has 
        an adder circuit, and a multiplexer circuit, and other circuts.
        You can use all of these existing circuits in combination with
        basic gates to build your alu.  You do not need to implement the 
        alu completely from basic gates.

* See the logisim documentation, and Wednesday's lab examples to help you

* If logisim seems to be freaking out, just save, quit and re-open your
  file again.
