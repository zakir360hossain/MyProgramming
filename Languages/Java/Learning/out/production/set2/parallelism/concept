"Parallelism is doing a lot of things at once"–––Rob Pike

Parallelism is enabling multiple threads to be executed simultaneously.
The component Scheduler in OS is responsible for assigning each thread to a core in the CPU, i.e main thread at core1,
thread1 and thread2 at core2 and core3 respectively.

Tools to enable parallelism:
1. Threads
2. ThreadPool:
   -ExecutorService
   -ForkJoinPool
   -Custom ThreadPools (eg: Web Services)
3. Requires more than 1 CPU cores.
