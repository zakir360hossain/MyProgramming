Deadlocks occur when a thread (A) is waiting to acquire a lock that is being
held by another thread (B) and vice versa.

Can deadlocks be detected at compile time easily? NO

However, there are tools to detect them at runtime:
1. kill -3 id (from console
2. JStack id (provided by Java)
3. ThreadMXBean (A Java API)

How to avoid deadlocks?:
1. provide a timeout for lock acquisition
2. Maintain consistence in the ordering of locks
