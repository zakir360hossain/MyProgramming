"Concurrency is about dealing with a lot of things at once" –––Rob Pike

Concurrency is applied to safety and efficiency management when shared resources between
threads are to be accessed/updated, or when multiple tasks need coordination.

In Java, there are numerous tools to deal with concurrency:
1. Locks/Synchronized
2. Atomic Classes (eg: AtomicInteger, AtomicLong)
3. Concurrent Data Structure (eg: ConcurrentHashMap, Blocking Queue)
4. CompletableFuture (1.8)
5. CountdownLatch / Phaser / CyclicBarrier / Semaphore etc.
