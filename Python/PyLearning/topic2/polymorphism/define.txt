# Polymorphism
# Sometimes objects come in many types or forms
# A button, there are many different draw forms of it (round, check, square, with image) but they all share the
# same logic: onClick()
# We access them using the same method. This is polymorphism.

# Polymorphism can be achieved through overriding or overloading in Python.
