Serialization (also called marshaling or pickling):
The process of converting a python object from python supported form to file supported form, JSON or, yaml.

Deserialization (also called unmarshaling or unpicking):
The process of converting an object from file form, JSON, or yaml to python supported form. Reverse of Serialization.


When sending the objects from python form to another language (not converting to file form) the objects need to be
converted to the form if JSON or yaml, because JSON or yaml are the form that many languages can understand.

Modules:
Python to file form and vice versa - pickle
Python to JSON and vice versa(some other languages) - JSON
Python to yaml and vice versa - pyaml
